## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Scarlett Red (#FF2400) to evoke a sense of urgency, revolution, and boldness aligned with the Y2K theme.
- Background color: Light steel grey (#D3D3D3) with a touch of silver to give it a futuristic metal-like vibe and a sharp modern edge.
- Accent color: Black (#000000) for text and prominent interactive elements to offer high contrast and assertiveness.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techno-futuristic appeal. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to make body copy.
- Use stylized icons with a Y2K aesthetic - think stars, sharp edges, and a digitized appearance.
- A modern and edgy layout with content blocks that pop. Consider a mix of full-width sections and structured grids to balance the visual impact and information hierarchy.
- Subtle but noticeable animations, such as star particles floating in the background, interactive hover effects, and transition animations to keep the user engaged. Use scroll-triggered animations to reveal content in a dynamic way.
